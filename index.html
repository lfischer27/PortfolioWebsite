            <p>I am a driven, resourceful, and creative person with a passion for storytelling and entertainment. 
My educational background in Computational Media – a union of computer science, media, 
communication, and design – has led me to a nearly 5-year career with NBCUniversal whose 
Media Tech Programs led me to gain experience in multiple organizations. This background 
along with my role as Co-Chair of the L.A. chapter of NBCUniversal’s TECHWomen makes 
me a distinctive candidate with both technical and operational expertise. </p>
